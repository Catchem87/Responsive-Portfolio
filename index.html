                    <p>
                        Ashley was born in Hamilton, Ontario and adopted by the Moras Family. She grew up in Oakville
                        with
                        3
                        siblings, an older sister and younger brother, also adopted, and a younger sister, who is her
                        parents'
                        biological child.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At a young age, Ashley discovered a love of dance and began her professional training to become
                        a
                        ballet
                        dancer at the age of 10. She trained professionally for over 8 years, attending the exclusive
                        Summer
                        Dance
                        Program as part of the Banff Arts Festival, for 4 summers in a row.

                        When she was 21, Ashley began her search for her biological parents. Although she grew up in a
                        wonderful
                        family, she has always been curious to know where she came from. She received her information
                        from
                        the
                        Government of Ontario and discovered that her birth mother's name was Kim and was about to trun
                        18
                        years
                        old when Ashley was born. After a lot of research she was able to contact her biological aunts,
                        only to
                        discover that Kim was not ready to meet or interact with Ashley.
